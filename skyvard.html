      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>Skyvard was once a unified island kingdom of floating cities, famed for its skyborne architecture and a culture that danced upon clouds. But fifty years ago, the Godfall ruptured the skies. Unstable arcane weather patterns—lightning that never ceases, flying beasts warped by storm magic, and island-breaking cyclones—ravaged the realm. Entire cities fell from the heavens, and Skyvard fractured into a loose network of survivor bastions strung together by storm-riders, airships, and desperate faith. They now call themselves the Skyvard Conclave: a people forged in loss, shaped by elemental chaos, and blaming Demori and Deviates for breaking the world.</p>

      <h2>II. POLITICAL STRUCTURE</h2>
      <p>Skyvard no longer has a central monarchy. Instead, it is ruled by a Storm Conclave, made up of five High Wardens who represent the last remaining major skyholds. Each leads one of the following holdings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thal'Korran</strong> – Fortress of storms and home of the Aethergale Vanguard.</li>
        <li><strong>Varixspire</strong> – Aether-powered port city and engineering haven.</li>
        <li><strong>Kaelmar Cradle</strong> – Agricultural oasis sustained by druidic stormbinding.</li>
        <li><strong>Torrinthal Bastion</strong> – Skyvard’s remaining arcane library, struck twice by skyfire.</li>
        <li><strong>The Maw</strong> – A lawless trading post ruled by mercenary votes and elemental treaties.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Conclave meets irregularly via projected crystal simulacra—a necessity in a land where travel itself is perilous.</p>

      <h2>III. RELIGION & PROPHECY</h2>
      <p>Ikaros, the reborn God of Sky and Sovereignty, is the state’s central deity. It is said that he fused his will into the first storm that saved Skyvard’s capital from ruin. His prophecy—"We will rise as those below break"—is etched into banners, blade edges, and the hearts of Skyvardian youth. Other deities have shrines, but worship is pragmatic: gods who can protect from skyfire earn faith.</p>

      <h2>IV. MILITARY & THE AETHERGALE VANGUARD</h2>
      <p>Skyvard’s martial force is led by the Aethergale Vanguard, a knightly order empowered by divine rites performed atop storm-spires. Each knight is chosen by Ikaros himself—or so they claim—and carries lightning-forged arms, enchanted cloaks, and unique warbrands called Tempest Sigils.</p>
      <p>The Vanguard operates in flights of 3–5 members, with elite “Cloudcallers” commanding localized weather phenomena. Their windwalk rituals let them launch rapid strikes and disappear like a breeze.</p>
      <p>Skyvard also deploys:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arc-Gliders: Floating siege platforms mounted with ballistae and storm-warped spellgems.</li>
        <li>Windjammers: Sleek airships capable of entering the heart of a maelstrom.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>THE ECONOMY OF MAGIC</h3>
      <h4>Magic as Currency</h4>
      <p>In Demori and its satellite nations, spellcasting itself is a form of currency.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spell Tokens</strong> – In the Upper City, the Summorum issues tightly controlled spell tokens, each containing a single-use cantrip or low-level spell imbued into a coin-like object. These are traded for services, and used by commoners who otherwise lack training.</li>
        <li><strong>Arcane Favors</strong> – A more elite form of exchange. A minor enchantment placed on one’s door, a 10-minute ward for travel, or an hour of illusion masking your identity—these can be traded in lieu of gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Soul Contracts</strong> – In the black market and undercity, magic is more desperate. Emotion dealers barter branded soul contracts, offering real magic for a cut of your spirit’s essence over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Magical Licensing</h4>
      <p>Each nation regulates the use of magic differently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Demori:</strong> Magic licenses are granted by the Summorum and expire yearly unless renewed via test or fee. Unauthorized spellcasting above 2nd level is a felony for non-licensed users. Repeat offenders are either branded, imprisoned, or conscripted into magical labor battalions.</li>
        <li><strong>Deviates:</strong> Slightly more liberal. Anyone can cast spells under 3rd level, but official jobs (magical courier, combat mage, diviner, etc.) require certification.</li>
        <li><strong>Skyvard:</strong> Magic use is survival. Any citizen who can wield it is expected to use it in service of stormfront defense. Independent use is legal, but heavily tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>Wildrune:</strong> Magic is a right, not a resource. All citizens grow up with druidic rites and arcane familiarity. They view Demori’s restrictions as blasphemous.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Arcana Trade</h4>
      <p>The arcane economy is also material:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spell Components:</strong> Rarer components (dragon teeth, lunar silver, whisper thorns) are worth more than gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Magitech:</strong> Devices combining arcane runes and mechanical function—like message globes, levitating carts, memory beads—are high-value trade goods. Demori monopolizes their creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional Energy:</strong> Since the invention of the branding marks, artificial joy, rage, fear, and despair are harvested and stored in emotion phials. Black markets use these to empower enchantments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Taxation of Magic</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spell Tax:</strong> In Demori, each licensed caster must register spells above 1st level for taxation purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Divine Tithe:</strong> Clerics and paladins must donate divine miracles to the state temple registry. Refusal to do so can result in divine sanction (or so it's said).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Wildrune’s Resistance</h4>
      <p>Wildrune doesn’t believe magic should be taxed, limited, or bought. They refuse to sell spell components or enchantments to outsiders. As Demori encroaches, Wildrune druids have begun "spoiling" magical land: making trees bleed poison, turning healing pools acidic, or enchanting animals to attack those bearing foreign sigils.</p>

      <h4>Magic as Class Warfare</h4>
      <p>The rich enchant their homes, their bodies, and their minds. The poor sell their memories to wizards, lease their dreams to illusionists, or undergo branding to receive food stipends. The world itself is alive with magic—but who controls it defines who survives.</p>

      <h2>V. CULTURE & ATTITUDE</h2>
      <p>Skyvardians are blunt, resourceful, and unyielding. They prize personal adaptability, lightning-fast decision-making, and loyalty to one's stormhold above all else. Children learn to fly before they walk. Falling is considered an initiation. A stormborn who refuses the winds is no true citizen. Many citizens undergo rites to bond with a storm—earning small arcane adaptations, such as crackling veins, storm-sight, or atmospheric resistance.</p>

      <h2>VI. HOSTILITIES WITH DEMORI & DEVIATES</h2>
      <p>Skyvard holds Demori and Deviates responsible for disturbing the arcane balance that led to the atmospheric collapse—especially after rumors of divine experiments gone awry reached their storm-halls. The colonization of Wildrune is seen as confirmation: the lowlanders break what they do not understand and now seek to tame even the Wildheart, a crime Skyvard considers an existential threat. Skyvard joined Wildrune in declaring war, seeing themselves as the last defenders of the world’s elemental soul.</p>

      <h2>VII. RECENT EVENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Maw was overtaken by a storm-forged warlord claiming to wield a divine thunder artifact. Some suspect they’re a rogue Aethergale experiment.</li>
        <li>Stormbinders in Kaelmar have begun growing crops that speak or hum during rainfall. The crops are sentient, and no one knows why.</li>
        <li>Ikaros appeared in a prophetic dream to a dozen children across Skyvard, warning them of “the Forge Rooted in Death”—interpreted to mean Demori’s Wildheart experiments.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />
      <h2>ECONOMY</h2>
      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>Magic in this world has reshaped economic power, especially in Demori and Deviates, where arcane advancements have overtaken industrial development. With wild magic more accessible than ever, economics is not just a matter of gold or labor, but also of arcane permissions, magical resources, and divine sponsorship.</p>

      <h3>SKYVARD</h3>
      <p><strong>Primary Economic Drivers:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weather-forged weaponry</li>
        <li>Storm glass (a material hardened by magical storms)</li>
        <li>Sky beasts (winged creatures bred for aerial transport and battle)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Economy of Scarcity:</strong></p>
      <p>Storms ravage supply lines, so Skyvard citizens hoard and repurpose efficiently. Traders are revered for their risk.</p>

      <p><strong>Magical Tradecraft:</strong></p>
      <p>Sky-sealed contracts: scrolls written in lightning glyphs, only readable after exposure to storm energy. Trade duels: merchant disputes can be resolved via magically sanctioned single combat.</p>
