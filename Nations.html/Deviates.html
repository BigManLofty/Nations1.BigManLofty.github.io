      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>Nestled on an archipelago to the east of Demori, the United Republic of Deviates was born from a generational schism within Demori itself. Once a failed colony of exiled mages, heretics, and political dissidents, Deviates has since evolved into a vibrant, experimental democracy where magic is regulated by law—but invention is celebrated as the nation’s lifeblood.</p>
      <p>Where Demori is lofty, secretive, and hierarchical, Deviates is loud, curious, and messily free. The two nations have remained political allies for decades, though a quiet resentment simmers beneath the surface—especially as Demori increasingly asserts itself as the elder sibling.</p>

      <h2>II. POLITICAL STRUCTURE</h2>
      <p>The Deviates Republic is governed by a rotating Triumvirate, elected every 5 years. Each seat represents a central pillar of their society:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Arcanum</strong> – Oversees magical regulation and arcane research.</li>
        <li><strong>The Concord</strong> – Handles civic matters, diplomacy, and public projects.</li>
        <li><strong>The Vanguard</strong> – Maintains military readiness and oversees international defense policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beneath them sits the Arcothene Assembly, a council of 100 representatives—wizards, merchants, guildmasters, and activists—who draft legislation, distribute magical licenses, and regularly squabble in public forums with magical flair.</p>

      <h2>III. CULTURE & PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p>The “Deviant Virtue”: Coined in the Republic’s founding charter, it refers to their collective belief that progress arises from deviation. To obey blindly is to betray one's potential.</p>
      <p><strong>Tinkermagic:</strong> The integration of mundane and arcane technology is everywhere—floating taxis, minor automation in factories, animated public sculptures.</p>
      <p><strong>Education:</strong> Magic is taught to all children by age 7, though specialized academies later sort talent into domains. The most prestigious is the Kavris Institute.</p>

      <h2>IV. FOREIGN RELATIONS</h2>
      <p>Though allied with Demori, many citizens fear they are treated more as junior partners than equals. Recent military collaboration has strained this relationship further, especially as Demori tightens its grip on Wildrune under the guise of "shared religious claims." Deviates maintains cordial but cold relations with Misso, and outright hostility with Skyvard.</p>

      <h2>V. MILITARY & INNOVATION</h2>
      <p>The Republic Vanguard: A volunteer force composed of magically-licensed battlemages, elemental infantry, and tacticians. Known for hybrid war engines that fuse ether-tech with summoned constructs.</p>
      <p><strong>Spellwright Guilds:</strong> Independent war-alchemists who sell to the state during wartime, inventing unstable but terrifying weaponry.</p>

      <h2>VI. RECENT EVENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A wave of magical unrest swept through the capital after a black-box construct was discovered beneath the Arcothene Archives, inscribed with forbidden glyphs linking back to Fyrrax.</li>
        <li>Public outcry grew when Demori troops, not Republic soldiers, were seen seizing land near the Wildheart’s reported location.</li>
        <li>The temple of Valiki Laz hosted a controversial masked parade mourning “freedoms burned at the altar of alliance.”</li>
        <li>A failed assassination attempt on a Concord delegate was traced back to a Demori-born radical. The investigation was quietly closed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ECONOMY</h2>
      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>Magic in this world has reshaped economic power, especially in Demori and Deviates, where arcane advancements have overtaken industrial development. With wild magic more accessible than ever, economics is not just a matter of gold or labor, but also of arcane permissions, magical resources, and divine sponsorship.</p>

      <h3>DEVIATES</h3>
      <p><strong>Primary Economic Drivers:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Education exports (academic tourism)</li>
        <li>Legalized magical experimentation</li>
        <li>Crystalized mana fields (mined sustainably)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Economic Ideology:</strong></p>
      <p>Free market arcana: spell formulas and magical patents are auctioned to the highest bidder. Licensing wizards rather than regulating spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Trade Partners:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Skyvard (rare metals, lightning-infused steel)</li>
        <li>Demori (shared magical research)</li>
        <li>Wildrune (clandestine trades for old-world druidic glyphs)</li>
      </ul>
