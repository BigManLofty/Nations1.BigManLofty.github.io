        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Nestled within and around the immense trunk of a god-grown tree known as Veridaxis, Demori is a vertical city of spellwork, politics, and secrets. Its upper tiers gleam with floating crystal spires, arcane elevators, and temples where divine law is debated more than obeyed. But beneath the sun-drenched canopy lies the Undercity, a cavernous maze of roots and shadows, where the magic is thin and emotions are taxed like coin.</p>

        <h2>City Layout</h2>
        <p>Demori is built vertically—a city of tiers, platforms, and districts suspended in or carved from the enchanted world-tree Veridaxis, which is rumored to have once been a god of balance or time. The tree’s roots extend into the Underdark, creating a city that is half sky, half subterranean.</p>

        <p>The upper city is called <strong>Mythrilspire</strong> and the lower city commonly is referred to <strong>Vitchelock</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Upper Canopy (Surface City)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The Crownlight District</strong>
            <p>The ruling elite dwell in floating towers tethered by <span class="upper-em">shimmering light-bridges</span>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spire-top villas rotate slowly in the air, powered by leyline anchors.</li>
              <li>Streets of crystalline glass that glow with soft enchantment at night.</li>
              <li>Reserved for Council Mages, divine scholars, and nobility.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“Magic is proof of your will. If you cannot bend it, you are unworthy of voice.”</blockquote>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Arxan Spiral</strong>
            <p>Home to the Grand Library, the Summorum Academy, and experimental labs.</p>
            <p>Books here whisper their contents. The library’s hallways rearrange daily. Arcane “rampants” patrol the area—magical constructs with quill-like limbs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sanctum of Turning Faces</strong>
            <p>Cathedral of Valiki Laz, the double-aspect deity of light and night. Pilgrims wear mirrored masks and trade secrets in shadowed alcoves. During the Festival of Masks, sermons are sung in riddles and dance.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Echo Courts</strong>
            <p>A coliseum for magical debate, duels, and legislation—half trial, half theatre. Law is interpreted by magical rhetoric and divine readings. The court’s roof is made of ever-shifting constellations.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Forum of Petals</strong>
            <p>Public Debate & Political Performance. A colossal circular terrace at the crown’s edge where politicians, philosophers, and magical rhetoricians speak. Open-air, with petals of glowing bark that drift down like confetti during high debate.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Veiled Spiral</strong>
            <p>Temple District of the New Pantheon. Winding temple platforms spiral up the living bark, each devoted to a different contradictory god.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Oracle Galleries</strong>
            <p class="oracle-p">Diviners, Dreamwalkers, Fate-weavers. A crystal-hung colonnade along the inner Treewall. Inside, a massive pool reflects alternate realities.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Heartvault</strong>
            <p>Jail & Magical Suppression Zone. Grown deep into the heartwood of the Tree, sealed by glyph-bark and runic iron vines.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Summorum Apex</strong>
            <p>Entrance to the Arcane Academy. Though the full Summorum is a sprawling vertical campus, this is the ceremonial entrance where graduates float down to receive their glyph-marks.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Glimmerloop</strong>
            <p>Noble Leisure District. Hovering cafes, music chambers, enchanted fashion halls.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Ringroot Market</strong>
            <p>Commoner Commerce. A twisted ring of branches where commoners live and trade—still beautiful, but clearly lower in priority.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Concord Vault (Demori Upper City)</strong>
            <p>Located in the roots of the Worldtree beneath the Summorum, the Vault is a spatially-expanded hall lined with thousands of levitating orbs and spectral tomes.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Chimefall Hollows</strong>
            <p>A nearly abandoned bellfoundry that once rang alarms through the city. Locals now use the giant chimes to send code signals through the roots.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Breach Spine</strong>
            <p>Collapsed Elevator Shaft • Hopeful Folklore. A massive central root hollowed by collapse—once an emergency lifter between upper and lower city.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Market of Mute Voices</strong>
            <p>Secret Bazaar • Emotion-Blocked Commerce. Every vendor and buyer wears enchanted silence cloths. All transactions are made through gesture, scent, or magic.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Fester Spindle</strong>
            <p>Fungal District • Semi-Sentient Mycelium Cult. Bioluminescent fungus networks both feed and house hundreds.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Forgotten Root</strong>
            <p>Civic Rot • Anti-Memorial. A cracked plaza that once held the council’s original entrance to the lower city. Now sealed, defaced, and left to decay.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Ironmire</strong>
            <p>Alchemical Waste Slum • Mutant District. Runoff from upper-city potions and failed Summorum projects pools here in toxic sludge.</p>

          <li>
            <strong>The Crimson Thread</strong>
            <p>Oracle Den • Fate-Debtors’ Refuge. A weaving hall hidden within the oldest roots, where acolytes of Avenyx spin soul-threads into cloth.</p>
