      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>Wildrune is not a nation in the traditional sense. It is a living land, a verdant soulbound wilderness, and a refuge of ancient druids, beastfolk, and arcane traditions untouched by imperial hands. Hidden by illusionary storms, warding canopies, and divine rites, Wildrune’s existence was long treated as myth by outsiders. But fifty years ago, in the wake of the Godfall, the veil thinned—and the world remembered Wildrune again.</p>

      <div class="leaf-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h2>II. POLITICAL & SPIRITUAL ORDER</h2>
      <p>Wildrune is led not by monarchs or councils, but by the Circles of Voice—groups of ancient druids, shamanic spirits, and fey-bound interpreters of the land’s will. The highest circle is the Circle of the First Breath, residing in the Canopy Sanctum, a temple of interwoven living trees older than recorded history.</p>
      <p>Each region (Gladeholds) is semi-autonomous, governed by its own Circle: Thornreach, Virellian Hollow, Lorrien’Va, and Myrrwood Deep. These circles defer to the land itself. Major decisions are not made until omens are interpreted, and the Wildheart’s rhythm is consulted.</p>

      <h2>III. THE WILDHEART</h2>
      <p>At the core of Wildrune lies the Wildheart—a colossal, breathing, magical entity entwined deep within the roots of the world. It is not a god, but something more ancient and unknowable. Its pulses dictate tides, storms, and flowering seasons. Those attuned to it can feel its emotional will—like sorrow before a wildfire, or joy when rains cleanse the canopy.</p>

      <h2>IV. MAGIC & CULTURE</h2>
      <p>Wildrune embraces all magic as a natural expression of self—sorcery is singing, druidry is breathing, bardic art is memory given root. All beings are taught to bond with a Totemic Echo—a beast, element, or emotion that shapes their identity. Elders can conjure full ancestral memories, and trees act as memory libraries.</p>

      <h2>V. FOREIGN RELATIONS</h2>
      <p>Wildrune shuns outsiders, but is not without diplomacy—especially after the colonial incursions by Deviates and Demori, who claim a “divine right” to sacred blooms that sprouted near Wildrune’s edges. Skyvard was the first to ally with Wildrune, offering stormsteel, secrets, and shared hatred for arcane tampering. Demori’s attempts to establish “research enclaves” have been met with open druidic warfare.</p>

      <h2>VI. RECENT EVENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Sacred Bloom of Ylluvien, a flower tied to the newly reborn goddess of memory, appeared in Wildrune. Scholars from Demori claim it belongs to their theology. Wildrune disagrees—violently.</li>
        <li>Some in Wildrune’s youth question the Circle’s non-interventionist ways and seek more active resistance.</li>
        <li>A tree in Myrrwood began to bleed black ichor and whisper "Fyrrax watches." It has since been cordoned off.</li>
      </ul>
