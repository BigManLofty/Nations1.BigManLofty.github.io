      <h2>Prologue: The Godfall (Year 0)</h2>
      <p>Following the events that concluded the last recorded era, the known pantheon of gods was shattered, rewritten, or reborn. Mortal scholars now call this the Godfall—an age in which divine essences reemerged across the Material Plane, not as restored deities, but as new beings, amalgamating ancient domains and foreign powers.</p>
      <p>These gods did not descend in unison, nor in peace. Each "broke through" into the world at different points, often accompanied by catastrophic miracles or revelations. (See the Godfall Event Timeline, Appendix I.) Most nations treated this new age with awe and trepidation. But it would not be long before reverence turned into ambition.</p>

      <h2>The Road to War: Timeline of Events</h2>

      <h3>Year 12 PG (Post-Godfall)</h3>
      <p>Valiki Laz manifests during the Festival of Two Veils in Demori. Her split nature—light and night, creation and destruction—becomes a symbol of artistic and religious duality. Her cult becomes state-sponsored, particularly by cultural elites in Deviates and Demori.</p>
      <p>Nalkira, the Drowned Flame, is seen erupting beneath the Bay of Smoke. Naval myths begin to swirl around her influence on tides and volcanic activity. Wildrune and Skyvard sailors begin ritual seawater burning rites, seen as barbaric by Demori theocrats.</p>

      <h3>Year 20 PG</h3>
      <p>Orunax’s scholars in Demori publish the “Thesis of Manifest Structure,” arguing that gods require mortal civilization to be stable. This becomes the foundation for Demori’s new Arcane-Divine Integration Doctrine. Meanwhile, Ikaros’ teachings begin to circulate in Skyvard’s floating citadels, advocating survival through adaptation rather than control.</p>

      <h3>Year 38 PG</h3>
      <p>Ylluvien the Dreaming Root begins appearing in shared visions among Wildrune shamans and Demorian astral scholars alike. Reports emerge of radiant flora blooming unnaturally deep in the Wildrune jungle.</p>

      <h3>Year 50 PG</h3>
      <p>Wildrune becomes officially known to the greater world. Its sudden appearance shifts allegiances and national interests from all surrounding nations.</p>

      <h3>Year 51 PG</h3>
      <p>Ylluvien’s Bloom is officially discovered by a Deviate expedition—an immense, shimmering tree pulsing with astral song and verdant light. The Twin Nations (Demori &amp; Deviates) declare it a universal relic, claiming religious and scholarly dominion.</p>
      <p>Wildrune druids reject these claims, declaring a Pact of Thorns with local spirits and ancestral memories. Hostilities begin with small skirmishes, burning of outposts, and the destruction of arcane monoliths. Meanwhile, magical storms begin forming in Skyvard, worsening by the month. Floating cities destabilize. Sky-farming collapses. Panic spreads.</p>

      <h3>Year 55 PG</h3>
      <p>The Sky Shattering occurs: a celestial rupture tears across Skyvard’s upper strata, dropping entire isles into the sea. Survivors cite thunder in the shape of a bird and lightning speaking with human tongues.</p>
      <p>In response, the storm-god Ikaros performs a divine rite, sacrificing his voice in the highest mountain peak. From the storm emerges the Aethergale Vanguard, a cadre of aerial knights imbued with storm essence. Skyvard’s High Council blames Demori’s continued magical tampering—particularly their use of divine frequencies to harvest energy from Ylluvien’s Bloom—as the cause of the storm cascade.</p>

      <h3>Year 57 PG</h3>
      <p>The First Flames of War erupt. Demori and Deviates establish the Sanctified Bloom Province in southern Wildrune.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wildrune tribes ambush a diplomatic caravan, reportedly killing four Deviate scholars and scattering divine relics into a living memory loop.</li>
        <li>Skyvard joins Wildrune, citing divine right and shared persecution. The Aethergale Vanguard strikes the Demorian border port of Vireth-Kaan.</li>
        <li>Demori and Deviates respond with arcane conscription and the activation of their first Living War Monoliths, semi-sentient divine machines powered by relics and oaths.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Year 58 PG – Present</h3>
      <p>The war escalates into full-scale conflict across multiple fronts. Theological debate has given way to militant crusades and wild, divine weather anomalies.</p>
      <p>Three primary fronts dominate:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The Bloomfront (Wildrune)</strong> – Jungle warfare, memory magic, druidic insurgency vs fortified arcane redoubts.</li>
        <li><strong>The Skystorm Front (Skyvard's Perimeter)</strong> – Aethergale Vanguard storm raids against floating mageforts and temple-cannons.</li>
        <li><strong>The Sea of Masks</strong> – Naval warfare intermixed with divine illusions from followers of Fyrrax.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>⚖️ Scholarly Reflection</h3>
      <blockquote>“It is perhaps unsurprising that the new gods, born of shattered domains and mismatched power, have left mortals in the same state—torn between reverence and conquest.”<br>— Thalius Mern, Unified Academy</blockquote>

      <hr />
      <h2>The Fractured Pantheon: The New Divines</h2>
      <p class="lede">“The old gods are dust. The new gods wear their bones like crowns.”</p>
      <p>Fifty years ago, something catastrophic shattered the heavens. When the Divine Veil was broken, the essences of the old gods bled into the world—colliding, merging, reforming. Mortals, beasts, and even ideas served as vessels for reincarnation. The result is a pantheon of dual-aspect, contradictory gods—new deities who embody tension instead of purity.</p>

      <p><strong>Pantheon Overview</strong><br>Each god below is a paradox made divine. Their worshippers often split into sects, each leaning into one aspect while wrestling with the other. The divine magic granted by these gods is often unpredictable—but potent.</p>
