        <summary>Demori – The Living City of the Spire (Overview)</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
<p>Summary
Nestled within and around the immense trunk of a god-grown tree known as Veridaxis, Demori is a vertical city of spellwork, politics, and secrets. Its upper tiers gleam with floating crystal spires, arcane elevators, and temples where divine law is debated more than obeyed. But beneath the sun-drenched canopy lies the Undercity, a cavernous maze of roots and shadows, where the magic is thin and emotions are taxed like coin.</p>

<p>City Layout
Demori is built vertically—a city of tiers, platforms, and districts suspended in or carved from the enchanted world-tree Veridaxis, which is rumored to have once been a god of balance or time. The tree’s roots extend into the Underdark, creating a city that is half sky, half subterranean.</p>

<p>The upper city is called Mythrilspire and the lower city commonly is referred to Vitchelock.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>The Upper Canopy (Surface City)</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
<p>1. The Crownlight District
The ruling elite dwell in floating towers tethered by shimmering light-bridges.</p>

<p>Spire-top villas rotate slowly in the air, powered by leyline anchors.</p>

<p>Streets of crystalline glass that glow with soft enchantment at night.</p>

<p>Reserved for Council Mages, divine scholars, and nobility.</p>

<p>“Magic is proof of your will. If you cannot bend it, you are unworthy of voice.”</p>

<p>2. The Arxan Spiral
Home to the Grand Library, the Summorum Academy, and experimental labs.</p>

<p>Books here whisper their contents. The library’s hallways rearrange daily.</p>

<p>Arcane “rampants” patrol the area—magical constructs with quill-like limbs.</p>

<p>3. Sanctum of Turning Faces
Cathedral of Valiki Laz, the double-aspect deity of light and night.</p>

<p>Pilgrims wear mirrored masks and trade secrets in shadowed alcoves.</p>

<p>During the Festival of Masks, sermons are sung in riddles and dance.</p>

<p>4. The Echo Courts
A coliseum for magical debate, duels, and legislation—half trial, half theatre.</p>

<p>Law is interpreted by magical rhetoric and divine readings.</p>

<p>The court’s roof is made of ever-shifting constellations.</p>

<p>5. The Forum of Petals
Public Debate & Political Performance
A colossal circular terrace at the crown’s edge where politicians, philosophers, and magical rhetoricians speak.</p>

<p>Open-air, with petals of glowing bark that drift down like confetti during high debate.</p>

<p>Guards of the Branch Tribunal hover around to suppress emotional outbursts or magical disruption.</p>

<p>Propaganda murals bloom and retract based on Council-sanctioned opinion.</p>

<p>6. The Veiled Spiral
Temple District of the New Pantheon
Winding temple platforms spiral up the living bark, each devoted to a different contradictory god.</p>

<p>Valiki Laz’s Carnival Temple: Mask vendors, dream-priests, and divine theater.</p>

<p>Aetheris: A shrine of rising wind currents and oracles whose hair floats in unseen air.</p>

<p>Ylluvien’s Bloom: A small grove of glowing blossoms said to revive the dying.</p>

<p>Ashram of Ichorus: The god of knowledge & madness—books float, whispers slither along walls.</p>

<p>7. The Oracle Galleries
Diviners, Dreamwalkers, Fate-weavers
A crystal-hung colonnade along the inner Treewall. Inside, a massive pool reflects alternate realities.</p>

<p>Gilded Augurs reside here—elite prophets who interpret the visions for the Council and public.</p>

<p>Admission is allowed only under special rites—most commoners see their reflections twisted.</p>

<p>8 . The Heartvault
Jail & Magical Suppression Zone
Grown deep into the heartwood of the Tree, sealed by glyph-bark and runic iron vines.</p>

<p>Holds:</p>

<p>Rogue mages</p>

<p>Emotionally unstable branded</p>

<p>Enemies of the state</p>

<p>Each prisoner is bound in a cell grown specifically for their magical nature.</p>

<p>Emotion suppression crystals pulse through the roots—similar to branding mechanisms.</p>

<p>9. The Summorum Apex
Entrance to the Arcane Academy
Though the full Summorum is a sprawling vertical campus, this is the ceremonial entrance where graduates float down to receive their glyph-marks.</p>

<p>Surrounded by statues of the first six Headmasters (each from a different magical tradition).</p>

<p>Divine brass orbs hover and record top spellcasters’ progress—visible to the public.</p>

<p>10. The Glimmerloop
Noble Leisure District
Hovering cafes, music chambers, enchanted fashion halls.</p>

<p>Arcane clubs where emotions are enhanced or traded like perfume.</p>

<p>11. The Ringroot Market
Commoner Commerce
A twisted ring of branches where commoners live and trade—still beautiful, but clearly lower in priority.</p>

<p>Magic is subsidized and limited—every lantern regulated, every charm taxed.</p>

<p>Guards more present here. Emotions are more tightly regulated.</p>

<p>12. The Concord Vault (Demori Upper City)
Description:
Located in the roots of the Worldtree beneath the Summorum, the Vault is a spatially-expanded hall lined with thousands of levitating orbs and spectral tomes. Each can be consulted by:
</p>

<p>Certified historians.
High-ranking officials.
Clerics of Orunax, Zethra, or Avenyx.
Chronochambers: Rooms keyed to specific decades, with environments mimicking their era.
Echo-Tomes: Translations of Orb recordings into readable text.
Black Vault: A sealed section containing politically dangerous or classified memories.

      <details>
        <summary>The Undercity (Root-Wrapped Depths)</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
<p>1. The Veiled Tangle
Formerly lush with minor magical growths, now a twisted slum entangled in decayed root structures and fungal bloom.</p>

<p>Emotion branding is enforced here via Divine Monitors—glowing glyphs that shock residents who experience intense emotion.</p>

<p>“In joy, you shouted and rebelled. In sorrow, you killed. Now you will feel nothing.”</p>

<p>2. Ashwalk Row
Smuggler haven, resistance hotspot, and home to forgotten rebel bloodlines.</p>

<p>Forges run off stolen leyline magic; music is banned here, but you’ll still hear it in whispers.</p>

<p>This is where Kas the Bloody-Handed was last seen.</p>

<p>3. The Chimefall Hollows
A nearly abandoned bellfoundry that once rang alarms through the city.</p>

<p>Locals now use the giant chimes to send code signals through the roots.</p>

<p>Rumored to be haunted by "The Scribes Who Remember"—a group who record every name erased by the Summorum.</p>

<p>4. The Glyphgrave
Decommissioned Branding Lab • Psychic Fallout Site
Ruins of the earliest BERRI testing facility.</p>

<p>Branded husks known as Hollowwept wander here, weeping laughter or screaming in silence.</p>

<p>Walls bleed shifting glyphs that reflect the fears of visitors.</p>

<p>Now a pilgrimage site for those who lost family to the first wave of emotion control.</p>

<p>5. Verminhold
Undercity Prison • Repression Overflow
A downward spiral of fungal cells and bio-grown cages.</p>

<p>Overflow for the Heartvault—home to political prisoners too inconvenient to silence publicly.</p>

<p>No guards needed. The cell walls themselves taste emotion and constrict accordingly.</p>

<p>The Warden-Root is a sentient tendril of the Worldtree—once kind, now lobotomized by enchantments.</p>

<p>6. The Ember Nest
Refuge & Healing for the Branded
Founded by a rogue cleric of Ignavar, this underground chapel glows dimly with pain-soothing light.</p>

<p>Infirmaries and hidden clinics care for the mentally broken and emotionally malfunctioning.</p>

<p>Many ex-soldiers come here, unable to feel grief for the atrocities they’ve committed.</p>

<p>If the revolution begins, this may become its triage center.</p>

<p>7. The Breach Spine
Collapsed Elevator Shaft • Hopeful Folklore
A massive central root hollowed by collapse—once an emergency lifter between upper and lower city.</p>

<p>Now a worship site of Molgrim.</p>

<p>Murals along the walls depict theoretical escape routes, revolution legends, and false saviors.</p>

<p>The phrase “The Spine Will Break Again” is etched a thousand times.</p>

<p>8. The Market of Mute Voices
Secret Bazaar • Emotion-Blocked Commerce
Every vendor and buyer wears enchanted silence cloths. All transactions are made through gesture, scent, or magic.</p>

<p>Emotions are dulled magically here to prevent glyph shock—creating a dreamlike feel.</p>

<p>Here, you can buy stolen Summorum research, time-sick artifacts, and cursed godmasks.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Council enforcers raid it—but can never remember how they got in.</p>

<p>9. The Fester Spindle
Fungal District • Semi-Sentient Mycelium Cult
Bioluminescent fungus networks both feed and house hundreds.</p>

<p>Inhabitants claim the “Sporespoken” give advice through hallucinations and aroma.</p>

<p>Druids are often drawn here—and feared for it.</p>

<p>Rumors say one spore cultist speaks in Zethra’s voice, knowing things no mortal should.</p>

<p>10. The Forgotten Root
Civic Rot • Anti-Memorial
A cracked plaza that once held the council’s original entrance to the lower city. Now sealed, defaced, and left to decay.</p>

<p>Street art changes daily—without magic. Murals depict uprisings, martyrs, propaganda torn in half.</p>

<p>At its center: a blood-crusted plaque that reads, “WE REMEMBER WHAT YOU FORGOT.”</p>

<p>Used as a gathering place for rebel speeches, midnight funerals, and illegal theatre.</p>

<p>11. The Ironmire
Alchemical Waste Slum • Mutant District
Runoff from upper-city potions and failed Summorum projects pools here in toxic sludge.</p>

<p>Twisted flora grows in iridescent veins. Some children born here glow faintly or speak in reversed time.</p>

<p>Considered cursed, but unguarded—perfect for hiding rebels or hosting secret rituals.</p>

<p>The “Flesh-Whisperer", a mutated former branding researcher, lives here and trades secrets for pain.</p>

<p>12. The Crimson Thread
Oracle Den • Fate-Debtors’ Refuge
A weaving hall hidden within the oldest roots, where acolytes of Avenyx spin soul-threads into cloth.</p>

<p>Each strand represents a choice defied or a life redirected.</p>

<p>Criminals come to change their fates. Rebels come to write new ones.</p>

<p>Every week, a massive tapestry is burned, releasing golden ash that dances like fireflies through the Tangle.</p>

        <summary>DEMORI PUBLIC INFORMATION ARCHIVE — The BERRI Program</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <h4>Title: The BERRI Program: Ensuring Emotional Harmony in Our Shared Society</h4>
          <p><strong>Issued by:</strong> Office of Public Welfare and Sentimental Regulation, Upper Demori</p>
          <p><strong>Distribution Level:</strong> Civic Orientation & Education Tier 1</p>
          <p><strong>Printed and approved by:</strong> the Council of Thirteen</p>

          <h5>What Is the B.E.R.R.I. Program?</h5>
          <p>The Blessed Emotional Regulation &amp; Resilience Initiative (B.E.R.R.I.) is a community-wide emotional wellness and safety protocol, developed in partnership with licensed divine and arcane specialists of the Summorum Academy. BERRI was created in the years following the Reconciliation Accords, during a time of great uncertainty, recovery, and pain in Demori's history. Its mission was — and remains — to cultivate a safer, more stable, and harmonious future for all citizens. Through divine-magic symbology and responsibly applied arcane resonance, BERRI helps participants manage the burdens of overwhelming emotion, offering a more consistent, peaceful quality of life — free from panic, rage, despair, or uncontrolled elation.</p>

          <h5>Why Was BERRI Introduced?</h5>
          <p>“Let no grief turn to wrath. Let no rage consume a future.” — Harmony Proclamation, Year 213 of Rebirth</p>
          <p>In the wake of decades of unrest and civil fractures, emotional surges among the citizenry posed increasing risks to personal, familial, and civic health. Recognizing this, the Council of Thirteen approved the BERRI Program as a compassionate, forward-thinking public health measure.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Goals:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prevent volatile emotional escalation</li>
            <li>Assist those struggling with trauma or ancestral unrest</li>
            <li>Promote divine-centered inner peace and spiritual balance</li>
            <li>Restore trust between upper and lower city populations</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>How Does BERRI Work?</h5>
          <p>At the heart of the program is the Blessed Mark, a small magical symbol inscribed via divine rites at the age of ten for qualified citizens (primarily in the lower districts, where social volatility is higher).</p>
          <p>These marks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gently detect overwhelming emotional states</li>
            <li>Deliver a small resonant pulse to encourage grounding and reflection</li>
            <li>If necessary, calm or redirect the emotional surge through arcane-empathic soothing</li>
            <li>Over time, help build resilient emotional patterns conducive to harmony</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The system operates with complete discretion and respect for personal dignity. No memory is ever erased, only stabilized.</p>
          <p><em>Note:</em> Participation is legally mandated for qualifying demographics. Upper city residents may opt-in to supportive versions of the program through licensed Summorum clinics.</p>

          <h5>Is BERRI Safe?</h5>
          <p>Yes. The BERRI Program has undergone decades of refinement, with ongoing oversight from the Summorum’s Division of Divine Ethics and Emotional Safety. Only accredited mages, divine practitioners, and social alchemists may administer BERRI-related protocols. Citizens experiencing “emotional dimming,” spiritual misalignment, or resonance disruption are encouraged to visit their local Wellness Chaplain.</p>

          <h5>Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
          <p><strong>Q: Does BERRI remove my emotions?</strong><br>A: Absolutely not. BERRI gently redirects harmful or dangerous emotional spikes to keep you and your neighbors safe. Joy, grief, passion, and expression are still celebrated in their proper place and time.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I request removal of my Blessed Mark?</strong><br>A: Blessed Marks are divine and permanent. If you experience discomfort or dissonance, please contact your district’s Sentiment Response Officer for guidance.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Why don’t upper city children receive marks?</strong><br>A: The Council has determined that the stress factors and environmental risks in the upper city are significantly lower. However, voluntary Harmony Meditations are available for all citizens through temple services.</p>

          <h5>Final Notes</h5>
          <p>The BERRI Program is a cornerstone of Demori’s post-Reconciliation success, and all citizens should take pride in its world-renowned stability and emotional innovation. Remember: Harmony isn’t silence — it’s when every voice knows when to sing.</p>

        <summary>The Concord Archive: Recordkeeping in the Fractured Age</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <p><em>"Truth is a blade. Kept sharp, it liberates. Let dull, it mutilates." — High Archivist Kel Varn, 3rd Era</em></p>

          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>The Concord Archive is the largest and most sacred network of recordkeeping across the known world. Founded shortly after the shattering of the Divine Veil, it was created to preserve history in a world where gods rewrite themselves, nations fracture, and magic can alter memory. While many nations maintain their own record systems, Demori's Summorum Archives and the Concord Orbs are widely considered the most accurate, incorruptible, and controversial.</p>

          <h5>1. The Concord Orbs</h5>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
          <p>Crystalline spheres roughly the size of a clenched fist, Concord Orbs float passively in spaces deemed "historically relevant" by decree of the Council of Thirteen. Forged with mirrored glass and memory-silver, these orbs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Float silently in the air.</li>
            <li>Record visual, auditory, emotional, and magical impressions.</li>
            <li>Self-sort into nested timelines stored in the Concord Vault.</li>
            <li>Are immune to falsification, illusion, or retroactive editing by arcane means.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Located in Summorum halls, council chambers, public trials, major battlefields, and divine sites. Some embedded secretly in rebel strongholds or foreign capitals.</p>
          <p><strong>Controversies:</strong> Some claim the Orbs choose what they record. Others argue they are used for surveillance under the guise of preservation. One known Orb went rogue and recorded a false prophecy that caused a rebellion.</p>

          <h5>2. The Concord Vault (Demori Upper City)</h5>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Located in the roots of the Worldtree beneath the Summorum, the Vault is a spatially-expanded hall lined with thousands of levitating orbs and spectral tomes. Each can be consulted by certified historians, high-ranking officials, and clerics of Orunax, Zethra, or Avenyx.</p>
          <p><strong>Layout:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Chronochambers: Rooms keyed to specific decades, with environments mimicking their era.</li>
            <li>Echo-Tomes: Translations of Orb recordings into readable text.</li>
            <li>Black Vault: A sealed section containing politically dangerous or classified memories.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>3. The Echo-Scribes</h5>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> A monk-like order of magically-trained historians who interface directly with Concord Orbs. Through a rite called Echo-Syncing, they enter a trance and relive recorded events, cross-reference impressions from multiple Orbs, and transcribe unified "echo-narratives" into official history. Echo-Scribes are known to go mad from repeated exposure to conflicting truths. Some serve as neutral archivists; others are pawns of political agendas.</p>

          <h5>4. Alternative Record Systems</h5>
          <p><strong>Wildrune - Seed Archives:</strong> Memory-seeds are planted in sacred groves. When touched, they sing their memories. Only Wildrune druids or Tzelite clerics can interpret them.</p>
          <p><strong>Skyvard - Warbone Ledgers:</strong> Carved into enchanted beastbone. History is ritually burned and re-inscribed annually to preserve focus on honor. Bones of traitors are rewritten to erase shame.</p>
          <p><strong>Deviates - Glyph Caches:</strong> Magical graffiti encoded with arcane runes. History passed through hidden street sigils and rebel art. Some glyphs mutate when looked at too long.</p>

          <h5>5. Orunax's Paradox Index</h5>
          <p>Housed in a massive underground reliquary beneath the eastern wing of the Summorum, the Paradox Index catalogs every known contradiction in historical record, possible timelines and alternative truths, and anomalous memories, wild magic surges, or divine rewrites. Maintained by the Bleeding Quill's maddest clerics, it is rumored that accessing too many paradox entries warps the reader's sense of reality.</p>

          <h5>6. Forbidden Practices</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Chronografting: Editing one’s own memory or lineage into Concord Orbs.</li>
            <li>Echo-Splicing: Combining multiple Orb recordings into a false narrative.</li>
            <li>Thread Severing: A banned Tzelite rite that destroys memory in all who knew a person.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All are punishable by soul-severance or rebranding.</p>

        <summary>The Veilbound Order: Knights of the Root</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <h5>Founding</h5>
          <p>Created after the First Rebellion, when the ruling class of Demori realized raw magic needed something more stable to protect it. The Veilbound Order was formed to be the physical hand of justice, restraint, and honor—balancing magical tyranny with martial purpose and deeply spiritual tradition.</p>
          <p>They are not governed by the Council, but are sworn to protect the will of the city and the safety of its people. Their charter cannot be amended without unanimous council consent.</p>

          <h5>Core Ideals (The Three Fold Vow)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Shield the Root</strong> – Defend the city’s heart, its people, and its legacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Honor the Veil</strong> – Respect magic, even when you wield none.</li>
            <li><strong>Break for None</strong> – Do not retreat, bend, or betray your oath—even to your death.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Ranks</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Veilwarden</strong> – The grandmaster and spiritual leader of the Order.</li>
            <li><strong>Silver Hands</strong> – Elite chosen knights (Dimitri’s rank).</li>
            <li><strong>Veilwalkers</strong> – Ambassadors and duelists; investigators of magical crime.</li>
            <li><strong>Grey Wrought</strong> – Initiates, acolytes, and squires.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Lore &amp; Culture</h5>
          <p>Each Silver Hand wields a Runeblade, engraved with an ancient magical vow that becomes personalized as they grow. Upon knighthood, they receive a memory tattoo—a living record of their vows that glows when they falter. Many Silver Vow members are non-magical, but trained to resist, disrupt, and contain spellcasters.</p>

        <summary>The Summorum</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <p><em>An excerpt from “The Harmonies of Authority: A Civically Approved Guide to the Pillars of Peace” — Issued by the Ministry of Instruction and Divine Harmony</em></p>

          <h5>The Summorum: Root of Magic, Pillar of Peace</h5>
          <p>The Summorum stands at the very heart of Demori's capital—a shining example of what unity between arcane brilliance and divine order can achieve. Built into the spiraling trunk of the World Tree itself, the institution is a living monument to the twin ideals of wisdom and harmony. From its heights, lanterns of divine light float on calming currents of magic; below, its roots cradle tomes so ancient the paper weeps sap. All true progress flows from its halls. All Demorians owe their safety to its teachings.</p>

          <h5>The Six Harmonized Disciplines</h5>
          <p><strong>The Vein of Light – Clerics</strong><br>Clerics are trained to channel the New Pantheon’s many domains. The Summorum encourages students to find unity in contradiction—just as the gods do. Divination and healing rites are primary, but so is the art of theological debate.</p>

          <p><strong>The Binding Blade – Paladins</strong><br>A sacred martial path, where honor meets spellcraft. Paladins swear to protect peace, law, and the Council's wisdom. Their strength is seen as a reflection of public trust.</p>

          <p><strong>The Spiral Flame – Sorcerers</strong><br>Harnessing raw power requires inner harmony. Sorcerers undergo spiritual refinement to temper chaos into constructive force. The Summorum offers excellent counseling for those born “too bright.”</p>

          <p><strong>The Oath and Star – Celestial Warlocks</strong><br>Guided by stars and patron spirits sanctioned by the Council. Emphasizes respectful channeling and clear contracts. Offers instruction on identifying unsanctioned or delusional pact phenomena.</p>

          <p><strong>The Loom of Thought – Wizards</strong><br>The great weavers of magical structure and logic. Home to the most rigorous tests, including the Law of Seven Threads. Spell modification must be approved by the Registrar’s Circle.</p>

          <p><strong>The Stonepath – Eldritch Knights</strong><br>Where sword and spell meet. Students undergo intense martial training blended with ward magic. Many graduates serve in the Pactguard, the city's elite peacekeeping order.</p>

          <h5>Organizational Structure</h5>
          <p><strong>Headmaster Selovahn the Preservant</strong><br>Elven. Current Headmaster of the Summorum and Grand Arbiter of Magical Ethics. Known for preserving the Summorum’s values through three regime transitions. Revered for helping introduce the “Emotion Regulation Protocols” after the Undercity rebellion.</p>

          <p><strong>Commander Valmyr Kellenhart – Chief of the Pactguard</strong><br>Veteran Eldritch Knight and Head of the Pactguard's strategic command. Known for leading the Council's Shield during the Ember Summit Conflict. Oversees all enforcement operations across both the Upper and Lower city.</p>

          <p><strong>Dimitri Savard – Senior Officer of the Pactguard</strong><br>Graduate of The Binding Blade and The Stonepath. Known for his exceptional service during the Frostspire Riots. Beloved by many citizens. Recently engaged to Amaryllis Alward, a decorated cleric.</p>

        <summary>THE TRUTH OF ORDER — A Civic Summary of the 187th Rebellion</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <p><strong>Issued by:</strong> Office of Upper Demori Historical Correction &amp; Public Wellbeing</p>
          <p><strong>Endorsed by:</strong> the Council of Thirteen</p>
          <p><strong>Distributed:</strong> Year 216 of Rebirth</p>

          <h5>A Tragic Flare of Ignorance</h5>
          <p>Fifteen years ago, the capital of Demori endured a sudden and tragic disruption — not by foreign agents, wild magic, or divine wrath — but from within. Stoked by dangerous agitators and forbidden ideologies, certain groups in the lower districts, blinded by resentment and envy, sought to tear down the very system that protected them. Despite generous offerings of food, mana subsidies, and divine favor from the Council, these individuals declared open rebellion against the peace of the High Tree. What followed was a calculated campaign of destruction: sabotage, magical uprisings, attempts to destabilize the sacred leywork, and the defiling of Summorum-aligned shrines. Worst of all, innocent families were caught in the crossfire — many of whom had no desire to participate in such cruelty. The rebellion lasted twelve days.</p>

          <h5>The Guardians Hold the Line</h5>
          <p>Thanks to the swift response of the Skyward Bastion, the bravery of elite Sentinels, and emergency divine rites performed by the Temple Chorus, the Council of Thirteen held firm. Demori did not fall — it blossomed in resilience. In a final act of mercy, the council spared countless lower city citizens, issuing pardons to those who renounced violence and accepted the guiding hand of governance. Yet mercy without memory is dangerous.</p>

          <h5>Harmony Forged Through Healing</h5>
          <p>In the wake of this breach, the Council of Thirteen wisely enacted the Harmony Resolution, initiating reforms that prioritized both safety and emotional well-being among the vulnerable districts. Thus was born the Blessed Emotional Regulation &amp; Resilience Initiative (BERRI) — a divine-aided program that empowers citizens to live free from the dangers of unchecked anger, despair, or extremism. Where once hatred took root, peace was planted. Where once chaos howled, a lullaby of balance now sings.</p>

          <h5>Remember the Roots</h5>
          <p>Let none forget: The rebellion was not heroic. It was a mistake, born of ungratefulness and fueled by lies. It was not an uprising of the many, but a manipulation of the desperate by the dangerous few. And let none forget that the Council of Thirteen, with unwavering faith, refused to meet violence with vengeance. Instead, they offered guidance, healing, and structure.</p>

          <h5>A Call to Civic Virtue</h5>
          <p>Today, Demori thrives — with stability, magic, and truth flowing through every district like sap in the Tree’s sacred veins. Let all citizens — upper and lower — reject the ghost-ideals of rebellion. Let them embrace their place in the symphony of the city, where each beat of the heart is tuned by divine wisdom. The rebellion has ended. Its memory is permitted only to remind us never to stray from unity again.</p>

        <summary>The Circle of Thirteen: A Treatise on the Council of Rule in Demori</summary>
        <div class="project-section">
          <p><strong>Compiled by:</strong> Archivist Tholen Mir, as commissioned by the Summorum Academy</p>

          <h5>I. Introduction: The Roots of Rule</h5>
          <p>The governance of Demori, our sacred city-tree, is neither monarchy nor pure democracy, but a convergence of spell, doctrine, and divine precedent. It is governed by the Circle of Thirteen, an arcane council bound not by blood, but by magical merit, doctrine alignment, and, some whisper, prophecy. The Circle is born of crisis. Its formation, in the wake of the Sundering of the Upper Grove nearly two centuries ago, was a response to unchecked arcane experimentation that nearly shattered the leyline matrix binding Veridaxis to our reality.</p>

          <h5>II. Structure and Composition of the Circle</h5>
          <p>The Circle of Thirteen seats twelve pillar representatives, drawn from the six disciplines sanctioned by the Summorum Academy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clerics – Channels of divine law and celestial intent.</li>
            <li>Paladins – Vessels of sworn oaths and militant order.</li>
            <li>Sorcerers – Bloodlines of power and raw magical instinct.</li>
            <li>Celestial Warlocks – Pacted visionaries, often tied to newborn gods.</li>
            <li>Wizards – Architects of theory and arcane structure.</li>
            <li>Eldritch Knights – Spell-forged warriors who bridge magic and steel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each discipline has two seats, ensuring ideological balance. The thirteenth seat is known as the Arbitral Voice—a wild card capable of swaying law, invoking divine reinterpretation, and declaring times of arcane emergency. The current Arbitral Voice is Director Lyssa Tevrin, a deeply controversial figure appointed during the emotional rebranding crisis, and seen by many as a symbol of authoritarian overreach.</p>

          <h5>III. Paths to Power: Ascension to the Circle</h5>
          <p>Councilors are not elected. They ascend through one of three paths:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spelltrial</strong> – A magical rite of passage performed before the full Circle, where the aspirant must demonstrate unprecedented mastery.</li>
            <li><strong>Doctrinal Consensus</strong> – When a discipline reaches deadlock or collapse, its successors are chosen by peers within the same field.</li>
            <li><strong>Prophetic Exception</strong> – The rarest path, invoked when a divine source marks a specific individual as destined for leadership. Such a claim must be validated by no fewer than four Council members and a formal blessing from the Sanctum of Turning Faces.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most Councilors serve for 15-year terms, renewable by acclaim or Spelltrial challenge.</p>

          <h5>IV. Function and Jurisdiction</h5>
          <p>The Circle governs through four key mechanisms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Codification:</strong> Lawmaking and doctrinal refinement, especially where divine and arcane principles clash.</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Direct approval of high-level magic experimentation, divine rites, and extradimensional contact.</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Authorization of military or magical force within city bounds, often enacted through the Veilbound Order.</li>
            <li><strong>Suppression:</strong> Control over dangerous knowledge—this includes censorship of spells, restriction of historical records, and emotional regulation programs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Council operates out of the Throne of Convergence, a floating platform woven from living wood, hovering above the Arxan Spiral. All proceedings are recorded by the Glyphscribe Choir, a collection of enchanted stones that echo every word spoken.</p>

          <h5>V. The Current Thirteen</h5>
          <p>A brief overview of notable members:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lyssa Tevrin (Arbitral Voice)</strong> – Director of Emotional Regulation. Advocates pre-emptive control. Architect of the Emotion Branding Mandate.</li>
            <li><strong>Ravel Syx (Wizard)</strong> – Keeper of Chronomancy. Aged backward due to spell mishap; appears as a child with ancient wisdom.</li>
            <li><strong>Aevin Marrow (Sorcerer)</strong> – Bloodline of the Obsidian Drake. Believes in magical supremacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Illyon Veil (Warlock)</strong> – Star-touched and half-blind. Speaks in dreams. Seen as a pacifist.</li>
            <li><strong>Kael Varn (Eldritch Knight)</strong> – Blade-Regent and wartime strategist. Distrusts magic for its own sake.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>VI. Scandals and Secrets</h5>
          <p>While revered in public, the Circle is rife with buried scandal:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Erasure of Councilor Luthas—a former cleric councilor who vanished mid-session. Records imply the Circle voted to remove him from time itself.</li>
            <li>The Sifted Vow—a rumored split within the Paladin discipline, where one sect secretly opposes the branding of children.</li>
            <li>The Prophetic Lockdown—divinations regarding the Tree’s fate have been sealed under Lyssa’s authority.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>VII. The Circle Today</h5>
          <p>The Circle now finds itself at a crossroads. War looms on multiple fronts, rebellion stirs below, and gods walk freshly forged paths. The tree holds—but for how long? Debate continues over the legality of branding minors, the extent of divine influence, and whether Lyssa’s ascension was truly “earned.” Some whisper that the Council no longer rules Demori—it survives it.</p>
