      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>The Misso Empire is a snow-laden, insular island nation built directly upon the body of what its citizens believe to be a dead god-mountain — a monolithic, crag-lined peak known as Aashvalar, the Mountain Who Once Breathed. Its people, the Misso, are a mask-wearing humanoid race with no visible mouths and rarely uncovered eyes. Misso culture centers on ritual silence, ancestral duty, and reverence for the stillness of death — which they view not as an end, but a state of spiritual perfection. While outsiders once speculated that the Misso were extinct, they have in recent years emerged as a strangely modernized, magically adept power with little warning.</p>

      <h2>II. THEOCRATIC STRUCTURE</h2>
      <p>The Misso do not separate religion from rule. Their government is overseen by the Tomb Assembly, a gathering of 9 high-ranking Maskbearers — chosen not by birth or blood, but by ritual awakening, wherein a citizen communes with the slumbering will of Aashvalar and returns changed.</p>
      <p>Each Maskbearer represents a facet of divine silence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Mask of Mourning</li>
        <li>The Mask of Endings</li>
        <li>The Mask of Patience</li>
        <li>The Mask of Frost</li>
        <li>The Mask of Echoes</li>
        <li>The Mask of Still Flame</li>
        <li>The Mask of Burden</li>
        <li>The Mask of Ash</li>
        <li>The Mask of the Unspoken</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Assembly’s word is law, and debates are held entirely in gesture, song-sign, and written glyphs, with full policy decisions often taking years to formalize — though the outcomes are disturbingly precise.</p>

      <h2>III. CULTURAL MOTIFS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Masks:</strong> Every Misso wears a sacred mask from age 2 onward, inscribed with family oaths and personal shames. To remove one’s mask is either an act of intimacy or a final condemnation.</li>
        <li><strong>Naming:</strong> Most Misso take single names, though titles are earned through silence-deeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Art:</strong> Misso art is eerily minimalist — long lines etched into black stone, echo-chants, and large circular cairns built for unknown purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Magic:</strong> Misso practice Voidshaping, manipulating stillness, echoes, and negative space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>IV. FOREIGN POLICY</h2>
      <p>The Misso Empire rarely speaks on international matters, but when they do, their messages arrive through black-robed envoys who speak in cryptic paradoxes. Although officially neutral in the current war, Demori scholars believe Misso agents walk among all nations, gathering omens and cataloging magical shifts. Several suspect the Misso had foreseen the Wildheart’s re-emergence long before it was detected.</p>

      <h2>V. MILITARY CAPABILITIES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silent Cohorts:</strong> Trained soldiers wielding void-blades and able to move without a trace across snow and stone.</li>
        <li><strong>Shadelings:</strong> Arcane constructs of ice and shadow that seem to act as both servants and guardians.</li>
        <li><strong>The Final Choir:</strong> A rumored battalion of Misso who have removed their masks and sworn eternal service until death.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VI. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A lone Maskbearer was spotted at the Festival of Turning Faces, watching silently from a rooftop. Their identity remains unknown.</li>
        <li>The Tomb Assembly has issued a rare public statement: “The Mountain will breathe again. We will not be the cause.”</li>
      </ul>
