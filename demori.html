        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Nestled within and around the immense trunk of a god-grown tree known as Veridaxis, Demori is a vertical city of spellwork, politics, and secrets. Its upper tiers gleam with floating crystal spires, arcane elevators, and temples where divine law is debated more than obeyed. But beneath the sun-drenched canopy lies the Undercity, a cavernous maze of roots and shadows, where the magic is thin and emotions are taxed like coin.</p>

        <h2>City Layout</h2>
        <p>Demori is built vertically—a city of tiers, platforms, and districts suspended in or carved from the enchanted world-tree Veridaxis, which is rumored to have once been a god of balance or time. The tree’s roots extend into the Underdark, creating a city that is half sky, half subterranean.</p>

        <p>The upper city is called <strong>Mythrilspire</strong> and the lower city commonly is referred to <strong>Vitchelock</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Upper Canopy (Surface City)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The Crownlight District</strong>
        <h3>THE ECONOMY OF MAGIC</h3>
        <h4>Magic as Currency</h4>
        <p>In Demori and its satellite nations, spellcasting itself is a form of currency.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spell Tokens</strong> – In the Upper City, the Summorum issues tightly controlled spell tokens, each containing a single-use cantrip or low-level spell imbued into a coin-like object. These are traded for services, and used by commoners who otherwise lack training.</li>
          <li><strong>Arcane Favors</strong> – A more elite form of exchange. A minor enchantment placed on one’s door, a 10-minute ward for travel, or an hour of illusion masking your identity—these can be traded in lieu of gold.</li>
          <li><strong>Soul Contracts</strong> – In the black market and undercity, magic is more desperate. Emotion dealers barter branded soul contracts, offering real magic for a cut of your spirit’s essence over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magical Licensing</h4>
        <p>Each nation regulates the use of magic differently:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Demori:</strong> Magic licenses are granted by the Summorum and expire yearly unless renewed via test or fee. Unauthorized spellcasting above 2nd level is a felony for non-licensed users. Repeat offenders are either branded, imprisoned, or conscripted into magical labor battalions.</li>
          <li><strong>Deviates:</strong> Slightly more liberal. Anyone can cast spells under 3rd level, but official jobs (magical courier, combat mage, diviner, etc.) require certification.</li>
          <li><strong>Skyvard:</strong> Magic use is survival. Any citizen who can wield it is expected to use it in service of stormfront defense. Independent use is legal, but heavily tracked.</li>
          <li><strong>Wildrune:</strong> Magic is a right, not a resource. All citizens grow up with druidic rites and arcane familiarity. They view Demori’s restrictions as blasphemous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Arcana Trade</h4>
        <p>The arcane economy is also material:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spell Components:</strong> Rarer components (dragon teeth, lunar silver, whisper thorns) are worth more than gold.</li>
          <li><strong>Magitech:</strong> Devices combining arcane runes and mechanical function—like message globes, levitating carts, memory beads—are high-value trade goods. Demori monopolizes their creation.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Energy:</strong> Since the invention of the branding marks, artificial joy, rage, fear, and despair are harvested and stored in emotion phials. Black markets use these to empower enchantments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Taxation of Magic</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spell Tax:</strong> In Demori, each licensed caster must register spells above 1st level for taxation purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Divine Tithe:</strong> Clerics and paladins must donate divine miracles to the state temple registry. Refusal to do so can result in divine sanction (or so it's said).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Wildrune’s Resistance</h4>
        <p>Wildrune doesn’t believe magic should be taxed, limited, or bought. They refuse to sell spell components or enchantments to outsiders. As Demori encroaches, Wildrune druids have begun "spoiling" magical land: making trees bleed poison, turning healing pools acidic, or enchanting animals to attack those bearing foreign sigils.</p>

        <h4>Magic as Class Warfare</h4>
        <p>The rich enchant their homes, their bodies, and their minds. The poor sell their memories to wizards, lease their dreams to illusionists, or undergo branding to receive food stipends. The world itself is alive with magic—but who controls it defines who survives.</p>
            <p>The ruling elite dwell in floating towers tethered by <span class="upper-em">shimmering light-bridges</span>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spire-top villas rotate slowly in the air, powered by leyline anchors.</li>
              <li>Streets of crystalline glass that glow with soft enchantment at night.</li>
              <li>Reserved for Council Mages, divine scholars, and nobility.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“Magic is proof of your will. If you cannot bend it, you are unworthy of voice.”</blockquote>

            <strong>The Arxan Spiral</strong>
            <p>Home to the Grand Library, the Summorum Academy, and experimental labs.</p>
            <p>Books here whisper their contents. The library’s hallways rearrange daily. Arcane “rampants” patrol the area—magical constructs with quill-like limbs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sanctum of Turning Faces</strong>
            <p>Cathedral of Valiki Laz, the double-aspect deity of light and night. Pilgrims wear mirrored masks and trade secrets in shadowed alcoves. During the Festival of Masks, sermons are sung in riddles and dance.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Echo Courts</strong>
            <p>A coliseum for magical debate, duels, and legislation—half trial, half theatre. Law is interpreted by magical rhetoric and divine readings. The court’s roof is made of ever-shifting constellations.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Forum of Petals</strong>
            <p>Public Debate & Political Performance. A colossal circular terrace at the crown’s edge where politicians, philosophers, and magical rhetoricians speak. Open-air, with petals of glowing bark that drift down like confetti during high debate.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Veiled Spiral</strong>
            <p>Temple District of the New Pantheon. Winding temple platforms spiral up the living bark, each devoted to a different contradictory god.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Oracle Galleries</strong>

          <li>
            <strong>The Summorum Apex</strong>
            <p>Entrance to the Arcane Academy. Though the full Summorum is a sprawling vertical campus, this is the ceremonial entrance where graduates float down to receive their glyph-marks.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Glimmerloop</strong>
            <p>Noble Leisure District. Hovering cafes, music chambers, enchanted fashion halls.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Ringroot Market</strong>
            <p>Commoner Commerce. A twisted ring of branches where commoners live and trade—still beautiful, but clearly lower in priority.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Concord Vault (Demori Upper City)</strong>
            <p>Located in the roots of the Worldtree beneath the Summorum, the Vault is a spatially-expanded hall lined with thousands of levitating orbs and spectral tomes.</p>
          </li>

          <h2>ECONOMY</h2>
          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>Magic in this world has reshaped economic power, especially in Demori and Deviates, where arcane advancements have overtaken industrial development. With wild magic more accessible than ever, economics is not just a matter of gold or labor, but also of arcane permissions, magical resources, and divine sponsorship.</p>

          <h3>DEMORI</h3>
          <p><strong>Primary Economic Drivers:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Magical Artifice and Enchantments</li>
            <li>Emotional Regulation Licensing (The BERRI program)</li>
            <li>Exports of refined spell components</li>
            <li>Divine-boon contracts for magical labor</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Class Divide in Labor:</strong></p>
          <p>The upper city runs on arcane academies, private magic guilds, and regulated markets of magical goods. The undercity relies on black market arcane trade, illegally harvested emotional commodities, and sympathy-based community bartering.</p>

          <p><strong>Unique Currency Forms:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Sigils” – Enchanted coinage embedded with temporary cantrips for small luxuries</li>
            <li>“Scrip” – Emotionally infused notes (contraband in the undercity)</li>
          </ul>
